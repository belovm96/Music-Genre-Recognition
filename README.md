# Music-Genre-Recognition-Project

Automated Music Genre Recognition has been a challenging and interesting problem in the field of Music Information Retrieval that is yet to be resolved. 
Having read a variety of papers that present their approaches to this MIR task, it was apparent that there is a potential for an improvement of the current algorithms deployed for this classification problem. 
Moreover, most of classification results presented in these papers are neither impressive nor compelling which served as a motivation for contributing to this area of MIR. 

With Deep Learning emerging as one of the most popular and promising Machine Learning techniques, it was decided to use Deep Neural Networks for the implementation of Music Genre Recognition algorithm. 

In this project, a novel Convolutional Neural Network Architecture is proposed, and its performance is evaluated on three audio music features: tempogram, chroma frequencies, and spectrogram. 
The goals of this research project are to determine which of the three features yields best classification performance on the proposed CNN, and to provide a discussion on the reasons why certain music attributes are more meaningful for discerning music genres than others.
